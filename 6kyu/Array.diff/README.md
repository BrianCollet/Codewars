# Description
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list **a**, which are present in list b keeping their order.

`arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]`

If a value is present in **b**, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

`arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]`
