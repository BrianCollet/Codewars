# Description
Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".

If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

`name + " plays banjo"`

`name + " does not play banjo"`

Names given are always valid strings.
